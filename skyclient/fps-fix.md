# Skyclient FPS Fixes

## Debug

1. Send a screenshot of your mods folder, so that we can know if you have any mods that aren't good for FPS or if you don't have the mods that help with FPS. If you don't know how to access it, watch

2. Type `/neustats` IN-GAME, and paste the result here. Do not copy the chat message it sends, it automatically copies the information we need.

## Optimizing

If you haven't already:

1. Type `/scc` in Minecraft's chat or go through OneConfig and select the "SkyClient Cosmetics" mod.
2. Click the button on the button labeled with "Setup SkyClient Again".
3. When the setup asks "Would you like to apply pre-optimized settings?", click YES.
4. SkyClient should automatically apply pre-optimized settings after clicking the button.

If you have 4GB or less RAM in your computer, go to your SkyClient profile in the installations tab in the vanilla launcher, click `Advanced Settings`, and in the JVM Arguments box, replace `-Xmx3G` with `-Xmx2G`
