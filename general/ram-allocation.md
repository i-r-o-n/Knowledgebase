# RAM Allocation

## How much RAM should I allocate to Minecraft?

* 3~6GB if you have 12+GB available
* 3-4GB if you have 8~11GB available
* 3GB if you have 5-6GB available
* 2GB (default) if you have less than 4GB available

## Isn't having more RAM better?

No. Unless you are playing a heavily modded content-based modpack with more than one-hundred mods, your game is almost never going to need more than 4GB. By allocating more than 4GB, Java will end up wasting memory and this usually results in worse performance. Also, by allocating more RAM to Java, you're preventing other apps on your computer from taking advantage of the RAM.

## But I have 32GB of RAM on my computer, so I'm going to allocate 30GB of RAM to Minecraft and you can't stop me

Please, please, please don't do that.

## Conclusion

There's no advantage to having more than 4GB, so you should allocate 4GB (or less) just in case.
